LeetCode Problem 127: Word Ladder

A transformation sequence from word beginWord to word endWord using a dictionary wordList is a sequence of words beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk such that:

- Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
- Every si for 1 <= i <= k is in wordList. Note that beginWord does not need to be in wordList.
- sk == endWord

Given two words, beginWord and endWord, and a dictionary wordList, return the number of words in the shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, or 0 if no such sequence exists.

Example 1:

Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
Output: 5
Explanation: One shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog", which is 5 words long.

Example 2:

Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
Output: 0
Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, so we cannot form a transformation sequence.

Example 3:

Input: beginWord = "a", endWord = "c", wordList = ["a","b","c"]
Output: 2
Explanation: "a" -> "c".

        Optimized solution using Breadth-First Search (BFS).

        The key optimization is in how 'one-step' neighbors are found,
        avoiding the O(N^2 * L) pair-wise word comparison of the original solution.

        1. Graph Construction (Preprocessing):
           - The graph is implicitly built using an 'Adjacency Map' (graph/defaultdict).
           - Keys are 'wildcard patterns' (e.g., "h*t") and values are sets of words
             that match that pattern (e.g., {"hit", "hot"}).
           - This pre-calculation takes O(N * L^2) time (N words, L length, L patterns per word).
           - Any two words sharing a pattern are connected, achieving the same result as
             the O(N^2) comparison much faster.

        2. BFS Traversal:
           - The neighbors() function finds all words sharing *any* pattern with the
             current word by looking up the word's L patterns in the graph map.
           - This neighbor lookup is O(L) time.
           - The overall BFS time complexity is closer to O(N * L) for traversing all
             nodes/edges, resulting in a much faster total runtime.
